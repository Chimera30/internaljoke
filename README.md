the concept of a music teacher who is underappreciated. This is support of his idea


A cell is the basic building unit of all living organisms
the cancer cell, indicates that cells and organisms can transmit and respond to certain frequencies. These can be physically measured and thus detect the presence of life forms in our bodies.
 And at the same time, for every living organism, there is a "lethal" frequency that can destroy it.
It is a non-invasive way to use frequency to destroy  (cells) that are harmful

idea:
/* ping bioelectromagnetic generator that allows us to perform targeted destructive action on cancer cells without disrupting the human body.

/*ping Another possibility is the action of a plasma generator, because its frequency can "illuminate" organs such as the liver, lungs, bladder, uterus, testicle, eyeball, digestive tract, teeth, bones and brain.
